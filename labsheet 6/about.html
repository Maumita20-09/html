            <h2>ABOUT WIPRO</h2>
            <p>
                Wipro's history is one of the most significant corporate transformations in India, evolving from a vegetable oil manufacturer to a global IT powerhouse in three main phases. 
            <p>
                Wipro was founded on December 29, 1945, in Amalner, Maharashtra, by Mohamed Hasham Premji as Western India Vegetable Products Limited. The company initially focused on manufacturing vegetable ghee, refined oils, and soaps under brand names like "Sunflower Vanaspati". Following his father's death in 1966, Azim Premji took over as chairman at the young age of 21 and began to diversify the business into a range of consumer products, including lighting and hydraulic cylinders. The company name was changed to Wipro Limited in 1982.

                The pivotal shift into the technology sector occurred in the 1980s, leveraging a void in the Indian market created by IBM's exit. Wipro began manufacturing India's first mini-computers and PCs, and soon pivoted to software development and IT services. This strategic reorientation was a masterstroke, capitalizing on India's emerging IT talent pool and the global boom in technology. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wipro had become a major global IT services player, listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2000, and achieved the distinction of being the first company to attain the highest levels of software quality certifications (SEI-CMM Level 5).

                In 2012, to maintain focus on its core IT operations, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a separate private entity called Wipro Enterprises. Today, Wipro Limited is a leading multinational technology company providing comprehensive IT, consulting, and business process services across six continents, with a strong focus on digital transformation, AI, and cloud computing, serving hundreds of Fortune 500 clients worldwide.
